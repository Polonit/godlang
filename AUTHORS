This project was first started on the 21th of November 2022 after a revelation from GOD to
Louis De Lavenne De Choulot, hereby referred to as Polonit. GOD told Polonit that he would
be his messiah and he would carry His words, Polonit then shared The Holy Words with some
of his classmates, and godlang was born, a programming language made to convey the
words of GOD to soulless machines.
